# Description of advanced.py

This code, is designed to generate and audibly present the multiplication table for a number provided by the user. It leverages the `pyttsx3` library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python, allowing the program to speak out the results of each multiplication step.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter a number for which they want to generate the multiplication table.

2. **Multiplication Table Generation:**
   - Using a `for` loop, the script calculates the product of the entered number with integers from 1 to 10.
   - Each step of the multiplication is printed to the console for the user to see.

3. **Text-to-Speech Output:**
   - For every multiplication step, the result is also spoken aloud using the `pyttsx3` engine.
   - The script constructs a phrase combining the number, the multiplier, and the product, and passes it to the speech engine.
   - There is a delay (`time.sleep(5.5)`) after each spoken output to ensure the speech is clear and not rushed.

## Libraries Used

- **pyttsx3:** Provides text-to-speech capabilities, allowing the script to vocalize the multiplication results.
- **time:** Used to introduce a delay between each spoken output for better clarity.

## Use Case

This script is useful for educational purposes, especially for children or visually impaired users who benefit from hearing multiplication tables spoken aloud. It can also be used as a fun way to learn and practice multiplication.
