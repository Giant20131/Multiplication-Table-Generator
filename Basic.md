The code is a simple Python program designed to generate and display the multiplication table for a user-specified number. It serves as an introductory example for understanding loops and basic input/output operations in Python.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The program begins by prompting the user to enter a number. This number is read from the console and converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

2. **Multiplication Table Generation:**
   - The script uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10.
   - For each iteration, it calculates the product of the current loop variable (`i`) and the user-provided number (`num`).
   - The result of each multiplication is printed in the format: `i X num = product`.

## Example Output

If the user enters `5`, the output will be:
```
1 X 5 = 5
2 X 5 = 10
3 X 5 = 15
...
10 X 5 = 50
```

## Educational Purpose

This script is ideal for beginners who are learning how to:
- Take input from users
- Use loops to perform repetitive tasks
- Display formatted output in Python

It can be used in classrooms or tutorials to demonstrate the basics of programming logic and arithmetic operations.
